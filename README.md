# 🏓 Python Pong Game

A classic Pong game recreated in Python using the `turtle` module. This project is a fun way to practice basic Python programming concepts like loops, functions, collision detection, and event handling.

## 🎮 Features

* Two-player gameplay
* Keyboard controls (`W` / `S` for Player 1, `Up` / `Down` arrows for Player 2)
* Real-time ball movement and paddle collision
* Score tracking and display
* Simple, retro visuals built with `turtle`

## 🐍 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries needed — uses only the built-in `turtle` module

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone or download the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-pong.git
   cd python-pong
   ```

2. **Run the game**

   ```bash
   python pong.py
   ```

   Make sure you're using a Python environment where `turtle` graphics can open a window (most desktop environments support it by default).

## 🧱 File Structure

```
python-pong/
└── pong.py
```

* `pong.py`: The main script that runs the game

## 🎯 Gameplay

* **Player 1 Controls:**

  * Move up: `W`
  * Move down: `S`

* **Player 2 Controls:**

  * Move up: `↑` arrow
  * Move down: `↓` arrow

First to reach the score limit (you can customize it in the code) wins the game.
